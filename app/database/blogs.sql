In the first place, they&rsquo;re not even a vegetable&mdash;and they&rsquo;re probably even more versatile than you think. &ldquo;Technically, peppers are fruits (berries, in fact), but they&rsquo;re eaten as vegetables, and there&rsquo;s a plethora of peppers out there,&rdquo; explains Julia Chebotar, New York City-based chef,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://healthchefjulia.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>culinary nutrition consultant</strong></a>, and former Food Network&nbsp;<em>Chopped</em>&nbsp;champion. &ldquo;In the age of the chili-head, there&rsquo;s a big market for habaneros, serranos, poblanos and New Mexico chilies as pizza toppings, while bell peppers can balance richer toppings such as crumbled sausage, caramelized onions and roasted garlic.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Peppers can even go beyond the food menu, where they shine in pizzas, pastas, appetizers, soups, salads and more. &ldquo;What I love about peppers is, because they&rsquo;re fruits, they work really well for use in cocktails,&rdquo; notes chef Brad Kent, a food scientist, co-founder of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.blazepizza.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Blaze Pizza</strong></a>&nbsp;and that chain&rsquo;s former chief culinary officer. &ldquo;They can really accentuate other flavors if you choose the right combination, like habaneros with apricots and oranges.&rdquo; In other words, the pepper possibilities are practically endless.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Sweet &rsquo;n&rsquo; Mild</strong><br>At the milder end of the pepper scale, bell and banana peppers remain fan favorites, adding characteristics like juiciness, tang or crunch, depending on the type used and how it&rsquo;s prepared. For example, Chebotar notes that bell peppers possess a natural sweetness, one that is further pronounced by the cooking process. But they can also add beautiful color and texture to dishes. &ldquo;When teamed up, these toppings make for a spectacular-looking pie,&rdquo; Chebotar says. &ldquo;If you want a full color spectrum on your next pizza, try banana, green, red and yellow peppers!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Fabio Errante,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fabioerrante.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>London-based pizzaiolo</strong></a>&nbsp;and author of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fabioulous-Pizza-tricks-professional-kitchen-ebook/dp/B081CYFT2W/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3TNZDRPPXBGDC&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.IvCsEDXRBsuIClWv3SsrYK-shOXvgCZ6FtXivY1p3AHLP_pcSowS6ZW_egrJOzu75BbI5XTwbLzY0PXdaZHjyg.Bvt7UusgpJ8_-ZGOfmsoD4SUPj4DdWMAuJrjlfIzvTE&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=fabulous+pizza&amp;qid=1745536043&amp;sprefix=fabulous+pizza%2Caps%2C241&amp;sr=8-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Fabioulous Pizza</em></strong></a>, agrees that peppers in general boast impressive versatility, especially in Italian foods. Red bell peppers remain his favorite&mdash;such as in a simple &ldquo;bruschetta&rdquo; that replaces the typical tomatoes with peppers, topped with melted provolone, or in his go-to pasta salad recipe, which combines red pepper cream, sweet corn, fresh arugula and cubed mozzarella.

Green bell peppers are a bit sour and pungent, so I&rsquo;d use them with meats or strong cheeses.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, banana peppers &ldquo;can do so much more than soup up your sandwich,&rdquo; Chebotar explains. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re one of the most underrated pizza toppings out there.&rdquo; Kent said he also loves the &ldquo;beautiful color&rdquo; they add to any pizza.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Heat &rsquo;n&rsquo; Smoke</strong><br>Seeking incredible depth of flavor with a little kick? Enter the world of hot peppers. If it&rsquo;s smokiness you&rsquo;re after, choose chipotles (smoked and dried jalape&ntilde;os)&mdash;they&rsquo;re especially useful in sauces. &ldquo;We see people using chipotle sauce as a base on pizza, instead of marinara or white sauce,&rdquo; notes Amy Wilson, managing director of Spin365 Marketing in Bentonville, Arkansas. &ldquo;Chipotle pairs well with many pizza toppings: proteins like pulled pork, chicken, bacon, steak, sausage and ham; veggies such as sweet peppers, black beans, corn, onion and cilantro; and cheeses like a Mexican blend, mozzarella or cotija.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Or you can mix chipotle with ketchup for a smoky dipping sauce, ideal for serving with fries or onion rings.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div id=\"attachment_66852\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-66852\" src=\"https://www.pmq.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/JULIA-CHEBOTAR.jpg\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" srcset=\"https://www.pmq.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/JULIA-CHEBOTAR.jpg 1000w, https://www.pmq.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/JULIA-CHEBOTAR-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.pmq.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/JULIA-CHEBOTAR-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.pmq.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/JULIA-CHEBOTAR-895x597.jpg 895w, https://www.pmq.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/JULIA-CHEBOTAR-302x202.jpg 302w, https://www.pmq.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/JULIA-CHEBOTAR-390x260.jpg 390w\" alt=\"this photo shows Julia Chebotar, with red hair and wearing an off-the-shoulder green blouse, holding up a slice of pepperoni pizza from a delivery box.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" loading=\"lazy\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66852\">\r\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-66852\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Julia Chebotar</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br>Meanwhile, Chebotar points to serranos and poblanos as perfect pizza toppers. &ldquo;Serrano is the spiciest of the green pepper pack, with a thin skin and thick flesh&mdash;excellent for eating raw in salsas, but also great roasted or grilled and then chopped up (no need to peel!) on top of your pizza,&rdquo; Chebotar explains. &ldquo;Poblanos, which get their name from the state of Puebla, Mexico, are perfect for roasting and stuffing, thanks to their heart shape and thick flesh. They&rsquo;re typically mild, though you may get the occasional spicy one&mdash;a great option for keto-friendly stuffed pizza peppers.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>As many modern palates seek ever-spicier taste sensations, an increasing number of customers are big fans of peppers that add a kick. Kent notes that hatch chilies &ldquo;have a more vegetal flavor that goes very well with tomato and works exceedingly well with cream cause. They reduce the heaviness of dairy and balance it out by adding acidity and a &lsquo;green&rsquo; flavor that enhances proteins like chicken. On pizzas especially, peppers just offer great flavor and texture to give the palate a break from the fattiness of cheeses.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The quest for the perfect peppers became a bit of an obsession for Kent. But he soon realized that canned or jarred banana peppers and jalape&ntilde;os weren&rsquo;t always up to his standards. &ldquo;They typically come from a faraway country and are heat-treated, which destroys texture and crispness unless a chemical is added,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;Also, because of heating and shelf life, colors fade, so banana peppers may have artificial yellow color and sulfites to prevent browning, plus a preservative for food safety. And it&rsquo;s the same story with jalape&ntilde;os, too.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Instead, during his tenure at Blaze, Kent worked with a family-owned pickle factory in Michigan to create high-quality banana peppers and jalape&ntilde;os. The peppers were fresh-packed, sans heat treating, and bolstered by natural color enhancers like turmeric. &ldquo;These peppers keep their fresh taste,&rdquo; Kent reports. &ldquo;They maintain their color, texture and flavor, and the jalape&ntilde;os retain their heat. We can then take advantage of those attributes for pizzas!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><em>Tracy Morin is PMQ&rsquo;s associate editor.
