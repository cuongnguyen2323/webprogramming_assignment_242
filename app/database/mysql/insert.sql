In the first place, they&rsquo;re not even a vegetable&mdash;and they&rsquo;re probably even more versatile than you think. &ldquo;Technically, peppers are fruits (berries, in fact), but they&rsquo;re eaten as vegetables, and there&rsquo;s a plethora of peppers out there,&rdquo; explains Julia Chebotar, New York City-based chef, <a href=\"https://healthchefjulia.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>culinary nutrition consultant</strong></a>, and former Food Network&nbsp;<em>Chopped</em>&nbsp;champion. &ldquo;In the age of the chili-head, there&rsquo;s a big market for habaneros, serranos, poblanos and New Mexico chilies as pizza toppings, while bell peppers can balance richer toppings such as crumbled sausage, caramelized onions and roasted garlic.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Peppers can even go beyond the food menu, where they shine in pizzas, pastas, appetizers, soups, salads and more. &ldquo;What I love about peppers is, because they&rsquo;re fruits, they work really well for use in cocktails,&rdquo; notes chef Brad Kent, a food scientist, co-founder of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.blazepizza.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Blaze Pizza</strong></a>&nbsp;and that chain&rsquo;s former chief culinary officer. &ldquo;They can really accentuate other flavors if you choose the right combination, like habaneros with apricots and oranges.&rdquo; In other words, the pepper possibilities are practically endless.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Sweet &rsquo;n&rsquo; Mild</strong><br>At the milder end of the pepper scale, bell and banana peppers remain fan favorites, adding characteristics like juiciness, tang or crunch, depending on the type used and how it&rsquo;s prepared. For example, Chebotar notes that bell peppers possess a natural sweetness, one that is further pronounced by the cooking process. But they can also add beautiful color and texture to dishes. &ldquo;When teamed up, these toppings make for a spectacular-looking pie,&rdquo; Chebotar says. &ldquo;If you want a full color spectrum on your next pizza, try banana, green, red and yellow peppers!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fabio Errante,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fabioerrante.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>London-based pizzaiolo</strong></a>&nbsp;and author of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fabioulous-Pizza-tricks-professional-kitchen-ebook/dp/B081CYFT2W/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3TNZDRPPXBGDC&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.IvCsEDXRBsuIClWv3SsrYK-shOXvgCZ6FtXivY1p3AHLP_pcSowS6ZW_egrJOzu75BbI5XTwbLzY0PXdaZHjyg.Bvt7UusgpJ8_-ZGOfmsoD4SUPj4DdWMAuJrjlfIzvTE&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=fabulous+pizza&amp;qid=1745536043&amp;sprefix=fabulous+pizza%2Caps%2C241&amp;sr=8-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Fabioulous Pizza</em></strong></a>, agrees that peppers in general boast impressive versatility, especially in Italian foods.

They&rsquo;re typically mild, though you may get the occasional spicy one&mdash;a great option for keto-friendly stuffed pizza peppers.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As many modern palates seek ever-spicier taste sensations, an increasing number of customers are big fans of peppers that add a kick. Kent notes that hatch chilies &ldquo;have a more vegetal flavor that goes very well with tomato and works exceedingly well with cream cause. They reduce the heaviness of dairy and balance it out by adding acidity and a &lsquo;green&rsquo; flavor that enhances proteins like chicken. On pizzas especially, peppers just offer great flavor and texture to give the palate a break from the fattiness of cheeses.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The quest for the perfect peppers became a bit of an obsession for Kent. But he soon realized that canned or jarred banana peppers and jalape&ntilde;os weren&rsquo;t always up to his standards. &ldquo;They typically come from a faraway country and are heat-treated, which destroys texture and crispness unless a chemical is added,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;Also, because of heating and shelf life, colors fade, so banana peppers may have artificial yellow color and sulfites to prevent browning, plus a preservative for food safety. And it&rsquo;s the same story with jalape&ntilde;os, too.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Instead, during his tenure at Blaze, Kent worked with a family-owned pickle factory in Michigan to create high-quality banana peppers and jalape&ntilde;os. The peppers were fresh-packed, sans heat treating, and bolstered by natural color enhancers like turmeric. &ldquo;These peppers keep their fresh taste,&rdquo; Kent reports. &ldquo;They maintain their color, texture and flavor, and the jalape&ntilde;os retain their heat. We can then take advantage of those attributes for pizzas!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Tracy Morin is PMQ&rsquo;s associate editor.

It&rsquo;s very versatile.&rdquo; Indeed, &ldquo;Roman style&rdquo; may describe a few options: Roman-style pan pizza, baked in a rectangular or square metal tray; pizza alla pala, formed in an oblong or oval shape and served up on a long wooden board; or pinsa, served on a smaller-size pala and made with different flours, like rice and soy.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you&rsquo;re used to making traditional round pies, such as the New York style, Recchia admits that Roman pizza might be a bit more challenging to tackle. But he believes the painstaking (and, traditionally, multiple-day) process gives the finished product an unforgettable flavor that&rsquo;s worth the effort.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"https://www.pmq.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/romanpizza-april25-Vitangelo.jpg\"></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 40px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; color: rgb(186, 55, 42);\">Vitangelo Recchia, who learned how to make Roman pizza with master pizzaiolo Massimiliano Saieva, embraces a three-step baking process and lengthy fermentation to create a crispy, airy crust.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 40px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Roman Rules&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Recchia, a&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(53, 152, 219);\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">U.S. Pizza Team member </span></strong></span>who studied the Roman pizza style under master pizzaiolo Massimiliano Saieva, nabbed second place with his Roman pizza (in the Pizza in Teglia category) in Parma, Italy&rsquo;s World Pizza Championship in 2022. He prescribes a three-step baking process for this style, allowing the oven to progressively dehydrate the dough.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">First, he cooks only the dough for 8 to 10 minutes, then bakes it another 4 to 5 minutes with the toppings, and finally finishes the slice in the oven (when ordered) for 1 to 1.5 minutes. &ldquo;The final product you get is crispy, airy and flavorful, with an abundance of tastes and smells,&rdquo; Recchia says. &ldquo;When you work this style properly, it&rsquo;s perfection from A to Z.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That signature flavor may end with the baking process, but it starts with the ingredients and fermentation. Recchia recommends using 0 or 00 Italian flour, fresh or dry yeast, sea salt and a quality extra-virgin olive oil. After mixing (see Recchia&rsquo;s full recipe on page 47), the dough can be stored in the cooler for 24 to 48 hours, after which the dough balls are formed. Rechhia makes each ball 1.2 to 1.4 kilograms, then lets them rise for 30 to 45 minutes and places them back in the cooler (at 42&deg; to 45&deg;) overnight. The next day, he removes them from the cooler and leaves at room temperature for 45 to 60 minutes, after which they&rsquo;re ready to stretch. He then stretches the dough into oiled pans and cooks his pizzas in 620&deg; electric ovens&mdash;ideal for baking, he explains, because you can control the top and bottom heat. &ldquo;Roman pizza is all about time and temperature,&rdquo; Recchia says.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When making Roman pizza, he adds, toppings are applied to the edge, so there&rsquo;s no raised crust like with a traditional round pizza. He makes his pies in 60-by-40-centimeter pans, which produce 12 slices, ideal for feeding groups of four or five. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a street food,&rdquo; Recchia says. &ldquo;You can cut it in half or fold it like a New York slice, or you can put it on a tray and make it gourmet. It&rsquo;s one of the most fun&mdash;and most difficult&mdash;pizzas to make. The fun part is the look on people&rsquo;s faces, which is very rewarding. The difficulty is in learning the technique.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the most fun&mdash;and most difficult&mdash;pizzas to make.

Now a bestseller on his pizzeria&rsquo;s menu, his second-place Pizza in Teglia entry was a white pie, which is called &ldquo;Crostino Romano&rdquo; in this style. Dubbed Heart of Parma, the pizza is topped with lardo, three types of mushroom (royal trumpet, oyster and maitake), porcini mushroom dust, local sausage, stracchino cheese, arugula and Parmigiano-Reggiano.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This year, he made a bigger splash at an Italian competition with a pie featuring a tomato base, cup-and-char pepperoni, stracciatella, Mike&rsquo;s Hot Honey and basil&mdash;all atop a four-hour-fermented dough. &ldquo;Italians would never do that, but Americans would,&rdquo; he says with a laugh. &ldquo;Italians may follow the rules of Roman pizza, but Americans are meant to break them. I like to give people an experience&mdash;and even if the Italians look at you like you&rsquo;re crazy, they can&rsquo;t stop eating it!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Perhaps more importantly&mdash;at least for his bottom line back home&mdash;is that Recchia&rsquo;s customers are similarly bowled over by the Roman style, even though he also offers Sicilian pan, New York round, Detroit, stuffed and grandma pan pies on his menu. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to do only Roman style; I&rsquo;ll spend more time explaining it than people spend enjoying it,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But when people try our Roman pizza, they say they&rsquo;ve never had anything like it. And they come back here because we have different styles of pizza.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, Recchia emphasizes that Roman-style pizza&mdash;already spread significantly in recent years&mdash;is currently &ldquo;blowing up&rdquo; in the United States. He predicts it will only grow further, thanks to a combination of improved education, more flour companies from Italy entering the U.S. market, and even manufacturers selling premade Roman pizza bases that operators can buy frozen and simply add toppings.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;People are learning new techniques to make the dough quicker, too,&rdquo; Recchia adds. &ldquo;Angelo Iezzi of the API [Associazione Pizzerie Italiane, or Italian Pizzerias Association] developed a system in the &rsquo;90s to make Roman pizza in 96 hours.

Long-grained rice (like basmati) flavored with fragrant spices such as saffron and layered with lamb, chicken, fish, or vegetables and a thick gravy. The dish is then covered, its lid secured with dough, and then the biryani is cooked over a low flame. This is definitely a special occasion dish.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is much debate of how this dish came to be, but most agree that its origins began in Persia as a rustic rice-and-meat dish and then traveled to India. The various recipes of biryani were then born, mainly where there was culinary influence from Muslim foods, particularly in the city of Hyderabad in south India, but also along the southern coast. Biryani\'s many, many variations depend on where the dish is based. Some differences are subtle while others are distinguished by added or substituted ingredients.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"https://www.thespruceeats.com/thmb/DdKf38-2eTL_5zsQ6Xce7k_9bvc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/all-about-biryani-1957507-finalv2-ct-806b7041d0eb42c1be8ae431de35cf17.png\" alt=\"what is biryani\"><br><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: rgb(149, 165, 166);\">Illustration: Colleen Tighe. &copy; The Spruce, 2019</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>The Components of Biryani</strong></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br>The main components of this dish are rice, meat, marinade, and spices. Basmati rice is definitely prevalent, but you will also find other grains such as seeraga samba and jeerakasala. Depending on where the biryani is from will determine the type of protein; coastal regions, for example, will include fish and shrimp, while inland areas may incorporate chicken, goat, mutton, and beef (mainly buffalo, but if cow, would be outside of India).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The meat is usually marinated before being cooked, and the most common marinade is yogurt-spiced based as the acid in the yogurt helps to tenderize the meat. It is the layers of spices that give a biryani its complex flavor, and these spices can be whole or ground, or individual or a spice mix (such as garam masala). Herbs and seeds may also be a part of the dish, which is often topped with caramelized onion, dried or fresh fruit, nuts, and fresh herbs.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Types of Biryani</strong></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br>There are several main types of biryani that are specific to certain communities. Each variety is named after the place it was created.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">- Sindhi biryani: This aromatic type of biryani is popular in Pakistan and known for its spicy taste, fragrant rice, and delicate meat. It is made with meat and basmati rice, vegetables, and various types of spices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">- Hyderabadi biryani: This biryani is one of India\'s most popular types of biryani. It incorporates goat meat that is marinated and cooked along with the rice and is seasoned with coconut and saffron.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">- Malabar Biriyani: This is the only version of biryani in Kerala, an Indian state. It is a popular dish eaten by the Malabar Muslim community and incorporates Khyma rice mixed with ghee.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">- Calcutta/Kolkata biryani: This biryani mostly uses potatoes and eggs and only sometimes contains meat. It is much lighter spice-wise; the marinade is made of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, cardamom, and other spices, and the rice is flavored with ketaki or rose water and is yellow in color.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">- Ambur biryani: This leather-tanning city in Tamil Nadu makes one of the most famous types of biryani, and the town has more biryani shops than any other city in the world. The meat and rice are cooked separately and then brought together, along with mint leaves and curd.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">- Lucknowi biryani: This type of biryani is based on a Persian cooking style so it uses the dum pukht method where the meat and gravy are only cooked partially and are then layered and served in a sealed handi. The spice profile is not as intense.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">- Mughlai biryani: This biryani is cooked with curd, chicken, almond paste, ghee, dry fruits, and green chilies, and has a rich flavor.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">- Kalyani biryani: Small chunks of buffalo meat go into this more budget-friendly biryani. It is rich and flavorful but does not include more expensive ingredients.</p>', 'app/views/admin/blogs/uploads/327f51d29ce1812de8a9c34cf21c18b5.jpg', 'Petrina Verma Sarkar', 'yes', '2025-04-26 11:52:10', '2025-05-04 10:47:26');
